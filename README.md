# LunisolarCalendar
A calculator that prints a calendar year for an example lunisolar calendar.
The calendar assumes that the sun and moon cycles begin in sync at the beginning of the first year.
Each year is 1 rotation of the earth around the sun, rounded to the nearest day, starting on the shortest day of the year.
Each month starts on a new moon and lasts for one orbit of the moon around the earth.
The months and year are brought into sync by adding intercalary days at the beginning and end of each year so that the first month always begins on a new moon, and the last month always ends the day before a new moon.
